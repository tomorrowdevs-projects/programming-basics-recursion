# **TomorrowDevs Programming Basics Learning Path**

## **Recursion** 

This repository is part of the full Programming Basics Learning Path by TomorrowDevs.

The aim of this path is to allow people to learn Programming skills by building practical projects.

## **Description**

The final purpose of this path is to allow you to build another real-world project that you can use in your life and present it as a project for your interviews.

In this case, you will build a **Cataloger of Household Objects**, using Variables, expressions, statements, string, conditionals, iterations and recursion.

In order to achieve that, you will be guided into different steps and tasks, composed by a combination of theory and coding.

Additionally, you will learn some **Soft Skills** for software developers.
