# Total the Values

Write a program that reads values from the user until a blank line is entered.   
Display the total of all the values entered by the user (or 0.0 if the first value entered is a blank line).   
Complete this task **using recursion**.  
Your program may not use any loops.

Hint: The body of your recursive function will need to read one value from the user, 
and then determine whether to make a recursive call.  
Your function does not need to take any arguments, but it will need to return a numeric result.
